In order to get the buttons to work right on mac, paste this into terminal :
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

If you don't do that then holding buttons to turn the car breaks.

Also you need to install the jbox2d library in processing. Go to tools, add tool, then click the libraries tab, search for box 2d and install that library.
